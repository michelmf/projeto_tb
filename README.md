# Abstract

Tuberculosis (TB) is reported by the WHO as one of the ten leading causes of death in the world. Worldwide efforts have been made to control such disease, which concentrates the highest rates of infection in underdeveloped countries, including Brazil. The tuberculosis in its pulmonary form is the most relevant for disease control, since it is responsible for the maintenance of the transmission chain, carried out by means of bacilli expelled during speech or cough.

The main diagnosis methods of this disease are the direct sputum bacillus infection and culture examination. The bacilloscopy has low sensitivity, around 60%, and the culture test result may take up to 12 weeks to be available. Recently, rapid molecular tests have been introduced for the diagnosis of TB, offering superior accuracy, but they require high costs and a specific infrastructure to be performed. In this way, the patient screening process as well as the experience of healthcare professional are determinant factors for the treatment of this disease. In this context, tools that support medical decisions are important for increasing the detection of individuals with TB.

This work proposes to analyze the performance of techniques based on supervised learning for the construction of a medical decision support system, whose main objective is to assist the screening process of patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis. Using data collected during the patient’s screening, the probability of such patient on carrying the disease is verified. The best computational model evaluated uses logistic regression, which reached 82.76% of sensitivity and 66.49% of specificity, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.761.
